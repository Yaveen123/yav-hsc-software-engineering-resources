## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Explain the differences between confidentiality, integrity, and availability in software security.  

<details>
  <summary>✅ Answer (3 marks)</summary>
  3 marks – Detailed explanation covering:  
  1 mark – Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.  
  1 mark – Integrity: Ensuring data remains unaltered unless modified by authorized users.  
  1 mark – Availability: Ensuring system reliability and protection against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  
</details>

**5.** *(3 marks)* Describe how encryption and hashing differ in securing data.  

<details>
  <summary>✅ Answer (3 marks)</summary>
  3 marks – Explanation covering:  
  1 mark – Encryption converts data into a secret format that can be decrypted with a key.  
  1 mark – Hashing transforms data into a fixed-length string that is irreversible.  
  1 mark – Example: Passwords are stored using hashing, while encryption is used for securing messages.
