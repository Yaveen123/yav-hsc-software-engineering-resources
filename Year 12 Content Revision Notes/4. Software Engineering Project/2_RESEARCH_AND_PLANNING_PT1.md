# Research and Planning Part 1 - HSC Software Engineering Revision Notes

## 1. Researching and Using the Waterfall Software Development Approach
The **Waterfall Model** is a **linear and sequential** approach to software development. Each phase is **completed before moving to the next**, similar to water flowing downwards.

### **Logical Progression of Steps Throughout the Life Cycle**
1. **Requirements Gathering** – Define what the software must do.
2. **System Design** – Plan how the software will be built.
3. **Implementation** – Write the code.
4. **Testing** – Check for errors and fix them.
5. **Deployment** – Release the software to users.
6. **Maintenance** – Update and fix issues after release.

### **Stages of ‘Falling Water’**
- Each stage **must be completed before moving to the next**.
- Going back to a previous stage **is difficult and costly**.

### **Advantages and Disadvantages**
| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|--------------|----------------|
| Easy to understand and manage. | Not flexible—changes are hard to implement. |
| Works well for well-defined projects. | Testing happens late, increasing risk of failure. |
| Good for projects with **fixed requirements**. | Not suitable for projects needing frequent changes. |

### **Scale and Types of Developments**
- Best for **large-scale projects** with clear requirements (e.g., banking software, government systems).
- Works well for **regulated industries** that require extensive documentation.

## 2. Researching and Using the Agile Software Development Approach
The **Agile Model** is a **flexible, iterative** approach where development happens in **small cycles** (sprints). Agile teams work closely with users and adapt to changes quickly.

### **Rate of Developing a Final Solution**
- Development happens **incrementally**, with a working product delivered at each stage.
- Allows for **continuous feedback** from users.

### **Method Tailoring**
- Agile methods can be customized based on **project needs**.
- Teams may use different Agile frameworks such as **Scrum, Kanban, or XP (Extreme Programming)**.

### **Iteration Workflow**
1. **Plan** – Define what will be done in the sprint.
2. **Develop** – Write code and build features.
3. **Test** – Ensure new features work correctly.
4. **Review** – Gather feedback from users.
5. **Repeat** – Adjust and improve in the next sprint.

### **Scale and Types of Developments**
- Best for **small to medium-sized projects** that require frequent updates (e.g., mobile apps, web applications).
- Works well for **startups and tech companies** where fast development is needed.

## 3. Researching the WAgile Software Development Approach
**WAgile** (Waterfall + Agile) is a **hybrid model** that combines **Waterfall’s structured approach** with **Agile’s flexibility**.

### **Understanding WAgile as a Hybrid Model**
- Uses **Waterfall’s structured phases** for **high-level planning**.
- Uses **Agile’s iterative approach** for **development and testing**.

### **When and How Intervention is Applied**
- **Early stages (requirements & design)** follow **Waterfall** for clear planning.
- **Development & testing** use **Agile sprints** for flexibility.
- **Deployment & maintenance** may return to **Waterfall’s structured approach**.

### **Scale and Types of Developments**
- Suitable for **large, complex projects** that need structured planning **but also flexibility**.
- Used in industries like **healthcare, finance, and enterprise software** where **some parts must be fixed while others need agility**.
