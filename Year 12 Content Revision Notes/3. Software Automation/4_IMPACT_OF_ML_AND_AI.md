# Significance and Impact of ML and AI - HSC Software Engineering Revision Notes

## 1. Assessing the Impact of Automation on Individuals, Society, and the Environment
Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are transforming **workplaces, economies, and daily life**. Automation powered by ML and AI can bring both **benefits and challenges**.

### **Safety of Workers**
- AI-powered robots and automation systems reduce the need for humans to perform **dangerous tasks**.
- Used in **construction, mining, and manufacturing** to improve safety.
- *Example:* Self-driving trucks in mining reduce the risk of accidents by operating in hazardous environments.

### **People with Disability**
- AI assists people with disabilities by providing **better accessibility tools**.
- Examples include **speech-to-text software, AI-powered prosthetics, and autonomous wheelchairs**.
- *Example:* AI-powered hearing aids adjust sound in real-time for individuals with hearing impairments.

### **The Nature and Skills Required for Employment**
- **Repetitive, manual jobs** are increasingly being replaced by AI and automation.
- **Higher demand** for workers with skills in **AI development, data analysis, and machine learning**.
- *Example:* AI automates **customer service chatbots**, reducing the need for call center workers but increasing demand for AI engineers.

### **Production Efficiency, Waste, and the Environment**
- AI improves **efficiency in manufacturing** by optimizing processes.
- **Reduces waste** by minimizing defects and excess material usage.
- *Example:* AI-powered smart grids optimize energy use, reducing electricity consumption and environmental impact.

### **The Economy and Distribution of Wealth**
- AI contributes to **economic growth**, but wealth distribution can become **unequal**.
- Large corporations benefit more from AI, while smaller businesses and low-skill workers may struggle to adapt.
- *Example:* AI in finance enables high-frequency trading, benefiting large financial institutions while potentially reducing job opportunities in traditional finance roles.

## 2. How Human Behaviour Patterns Influence ML and AI Software Development
ML and AI models are trained on **human-generated data**, which means they often **reflect patterns in human behaviour**. Understanding these patterns helps improve AI systems.

### **Psychological Responses**
- AI can be designed to **mimic human decision-making** based on psychology.
- Emotional AI analyzes **tone of voice, facial expressions, and text sentiment**.
- *Example:* AI in customer service detects when a caller is frustrated and redirects them to a human agent.

### **Patterns Related to Acute Stress Response**
- AI models analyze human responses to stress for **better crisis management tools**.
- Used in **mental health applications and emergency response AI**.
- *Example:* AI chatbots like Woebot provide **real-time mental health support** by detecting stress patterns in messages.

### **Cultural Protocols**
- AI must consider **different cultural norms and traditions** when interacting with users globally.
- Avoids **misunderstandings in communication and decision-making**.
- *Example:* AI voice assistants adjust responses based on cultural contextâ€”formal in Japan, casual in the US.

### **Belief Systems**
- AI systems trained on **biased datasets** may **reflect societal biases**.
- Developers must **consider ethical implications** when designing AI solutions.
- *Example:* AI-powered recruitment tools must be tested to avoid bias against certain demographics.

## 3. Investigating Bias in ML and AI Development
AI systems are only as good as the **data they are trained on**. Bias in datasets can lead to **unfair or inaccurate outcomes**.

### **Types of Bias in AI and ML**
- **Selection Bias:** The training data does not represent the entire population.
- **Confirmation Bias:** AI reinforces existing human biases in decision-making.
- **Historical Bias:** Data reflects past inequalities (e.g., hiring discrimination in job applications).

### **Real-World Examples of AI Bias**
- **Facial Recognition Bias:** AI struggles to recognize faces of different ethnicities if the training data is not diverse.
- **Hiring Algorithms:** AI tools used for hiring have been found to favor men over women due to past hiring data.
- **Loan Approval AI:** AI models may reject loans unfairly if trained on biased financial records.

### **When Bias is Intentional**
While many efforts focus on **removing bias**, in some cases, bias is **deliberately introduced** to make an AI model behave in a specific way.

- **AI in Roleplaying Games:** AI models used in interactive storytelling or roleplaying games (e.g., Dungeons & Dragons chatbots) are biased towards **producing creative, engaging, and fantasy-themed responses** rather than factual statements.
- **AI for Personalized Marketing:** AI models in marketing may prioritize certain products over others based on user preferences and purchasing history, **intentionally favoring more profitable recommendations**.
- **Content Moderation AI:** Social media platforms train AI to **bias toward removing harmful content**, prioritizing safety over unrestricted speech.

### **How to Reduce Unwanted Bias in AI**
- **Use diverse datasets** that represent all groups fairly.
- **Test AI models** for unintended biases before deployment.
- **Regularly update models** to reflect changing societal values.
- *Example:* Google adjusted its AI to reduce racial bias in image recognition software.
