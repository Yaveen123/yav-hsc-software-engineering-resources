## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Explain the importance of **assessing scheduling and financial feasibility** in software development. Provide an example.  
- **1 mark** for explaining that scheduling feasibility ensures the project is completed on time.  
- **1 mark** for stating that financial feasibility determines if resources are sufficient for development.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., a startup with limited funds choosing an MVP approach).  

**5.** *(3 marks)* Describe how **storyboarding and mind-mapping** help in developing software solutions.  
- **1 mark** for defining storyboarding as a method for mapping user interactions and UI flow.  
- **1 mark** for defining mind-mapping as a way to visually connect different aspects of the project.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., a storyboard showing a user journey from login to checkout).  

**6.** *(3 marks)* What are the key differences between **direct, phased, parallel, and pilot implementation methods**? Provide an example for each.  
- **1 mark** for defining and providing an example of **direct implementation** (e.g., immediately switching to a new system).  
- **1 mark** for defining and providing an example of **phased implementation** (e.g., rolling out new banking features gradually).  
- **1 mark** for defining and providing an example of **parallel or pilot implementation** (e.g., running both old and new systems simultaneously in a small region before full deployment).

- **1 mark** for describing a common algorithm (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest path problems).  
- **1 mark** for providing an example of its real-world application (e.g., Google Maps finding the fastest route).  

**8.** *(4 marks)* How does the process of **testing and debugging** contribute to successful software development? Provide examples of different types of testing.  
- **1 mark** for defining testing as a process to identify software defects before release.  
- **1 mark** for defining debugging as locating and fixing those defects.  
- **1 mark** for describing different types of testing (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, system testing).  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., unit testing a login function to ensure it validates credentials correctly).  

**9.** *(4 marks)* Explain the **importance of defining data structures and data types** in software development. Provide examples of different data structures used in programming.  
- **1 mark** for explaining that proper data structures optimize efficiency and organization.  
- **1 mark** for describing different data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, hash tables).  
- **1 mark** for discussing the importance of selecting appropriate data types (e.g., integers for numeric calculations, strings for text processing).  
- **1 mark** for providing examples of real-world use cases (e.g., using hash tables in a caching system to store frequently accessed data).
