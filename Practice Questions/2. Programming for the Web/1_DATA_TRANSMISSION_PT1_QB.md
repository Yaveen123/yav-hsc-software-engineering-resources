# **Practice Questions: Data Transmission Using the Web (Part 1)**

## **Multiple Choice Questions**

**1.** *(1 mark)* What is the primary function of the **Domain Name System (DNS)**?  
   - A) Encrypting web traffic between clients and servers  
   - B)➡️ Converting domain names into IP addresses  
   - C) Controlling data transmission speeds  
   - D) Managing firewall security rules  

**2.** *(1 mark)* Which of the following correctly describes **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**?  
   - A) They require installation from an app store  
   - B)➡️ They function like native apps but run in a browser  
   - C) They do not work offline  
   - D) They do not support push notifications

## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Describe the three main components of a **data packet** and their functions in internet communication.  
The three main components of a data packet include the header, in which addressing information (sender/reciever IP address) and protocol information is stored (allowing the packet to reach it's destination corerctly), the payload, where the actual data of the packet is stored (where information is stored for transmission), and the footer, storing a stop code (ensuring that the reciever knows when the data stops) and error correction (ensuring that any errors are dealt with)

**5.** *(3 marks)* Explain the difference between **IPv4 and IPv6**, and why IPv6 is needed.  
IPv4 is an older, 32 bit addressing system, whereas IPv6 is a more modern, 128 bit addressing system. IPv6 is required as the 32-bit space of IPv4 systems has been exhaused, leading to a shortage of unique IP addresses. IPv6 solves this by allowing for more space. 

**6.** *(3 marks)* Compare **FTP and SFTP** in terms of security and functionality.  
File Transfer Protocol and Secure File Transfer Protocol both serve as protocols of which files are transferred between a client and a server. FTP provides no security, as all files are transmitted in plain-text. SFTP solves this by adding support for encryption by functioning over SSH.

## **Extended Response Questions**

**7.** *(4 marks)* Discuss the importance of **secure email transmission** and how protocols such as **SMTP, POP3, and IMAP** function to manage email communication.  

**8.** *(4 marks)* Explain how **SSL/TLS encryption** protects sensitive data during online transactions and give a real-world example of its use.  

**9.** *(4 marks)* How do **data transmission protocols (such as TCP/IP, FTP, and DNS)** work together to enable the functioning of the internet? Provide examples.
