## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Describe the three main components of a **data packet** and their functions in internet communication.  
- **1 mark** for defining the **header** (contains source/destination IP addresses and control information).  
- **1 mark** for defining the **payload** (the actual data being transmitted).  
- **1 mark** for defining the **footer** (signals the end of the packet and error detection information).  

**5.** *(3 marks)* Explain the difference between **IPv4 and IPv6**, and why IPv6 is needed.  
- **1 mark** for describing **IPv4** as a 32-bit addressing system (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).  
- **1 mark** for describing **IPv6** as a 128-bit addressing system (e.g., `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`).  
- **1 mark** for explaining that IPv6 is necessary due to **the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses**.  

**6.** *(3 marks)* Compare **FTP and SFTP** in terms of security and functionality.  
- **1 mark** for describing **FTP** as an unencrypted file transfer protocol (port 21).  
- **1 mark** for describing **SFTP** as a secure file transfer protocol that uses SSH encryption (port 22).  
- **1 mark** for explaining that **SFTP is preferred for secure file transfers** to protect data.

## **Extended Response Questions**

**7.** *(4 marks)* Discuss the importance of **secure email transmission** and how protocols such as **SMTP, POP3, and IMAP** function to manage email communication.  
- **1 mark** for explaining the role of **SMTP** (sending outgoing emails, port 25 or 587 for encryption).  
- **1 mark** for explaining the role of **POP3** (retrieves emails from the server, removes them after download).  
- **1 mark** for explaining the role of **IMAP** (retrieves and syncs emails across multiple devices).  
- **1 mark** for discussing why **encryption is necessary** to secure email transmission.  

**8.** *(4 marks)* Explain how **SSL/TLS encryption** protects sensitive data during online transactions and give a real-world example of its use.  
- **1 mark** for describing **SSL/TLS as encryption protocols** that secure data between client and server.  
- **1 mark** for explaining **how HTTPS uses TLS encryption** for web security.  
- **1 mark** for discussing how **TLS prevents man-in-the-middle attacks**.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., **online banking, secure login pages**).  

**9.** *(4 marks)* How do **data transmission protocols (such as TCP/IP, FTP, and DNS)** work together to enable the functioning of the internet? Provide examples.  
- **1 mark** for explaining **TCP/IP’s role** in breaking data into packets and reassembling them.  
- **1 mark** for explaining **DNS’s role** in resolving domain names into IP addresses.  
- **1 mark** for explaining **FTP’s role** in transferring files between servers and clients.  
- **1 mark** for providing an example (e.g., **loading a website, sending a file via FTP**).
