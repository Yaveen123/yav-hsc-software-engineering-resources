## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Describe three key security benefits of developing secure software.  
> Developing secure software ensures that data in a software system remains confidential (only seen by authorised users), retains integrity (data is a single point of truth), and is availablity (always accessible to whom it may concern) through preventing cybersecurity attacks such as XSS and CSRF attacks. Developing secure software also ensures that the software remains legally compliant with regulations such as the GDPR.

**5.** *(3 marks)* Explain how encryption and authentication help protect data in software systems.  
> Encryption is a two way process, making data unreadable unless a key is presented to decrypt the data. This ensures that data retains its confidentiality, as only restricted people can view the data. Authentication refers to the process where users are authorised to access data or software system. Through verifying the user, authentication ensures the confidentality of data as only authorised people can look at the data. Authentication also ensures the data retains its integrity, as only authorised people can modify/delete the data. Authentication systems can also prevent attacks that compromise the availiability of data, like DoS attacks.

> Threat modeling is the process of
