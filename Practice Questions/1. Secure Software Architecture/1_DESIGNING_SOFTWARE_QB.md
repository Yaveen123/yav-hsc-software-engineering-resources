## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* Describe three key security benefits of developing secure software.  
> Developing secure software increases the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and services, by closing security vulnerabilities such as SQL injections and XSS attacks. The mitigation of security risks and secure software design ensures that software meets regulatory compliance, like the GDPR. 

**5.** *(3 marks)* Explain how encryption and authentication help protect data in software systems.  
> Encryption refers to the two-way process of making data unreadable unless a key is provided, for example using TLS for securing data in web transit. Authentication in cybersecurity refers to the process of only allowing authorised users to access of parts of a software system, for example asking users to sign into Google before allowing interactions on YouTube. Encryption ensures that data cannot be read unless authorised parties are given access to that data, increasing the confidentiality of the data. Authentication helps prevents unauthorised users from accessing a system, increasing the integrity of data. 

**6.** *(3 marks)* Describe the role of threat modeling in the software design process.
