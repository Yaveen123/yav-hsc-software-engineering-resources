# **Practice Questions: Designing Software**

## **Multiple Choice Questions**

**1.** *(1 mark)* What is the main benefit of developing secure software?  
   - A) It reduces software development costs  
   - B) It ensures software runs faster  
   - C) ➡️ ✅ It protects data, users, and systems from cyber threats  
   - D) It increases the software's popularity  

**2.** *(1 mark)* Which of the following is an example of a security vulnerability?  
   - A) Using multi-factor authentication  
   - B) ➡️ ✅ Allowing users to set weak passwords  
   - C) Encrypting all stored data  
   - D) Implementing secure API connections  

**3.** *(1 mark)* Which of the following is NOT a security testing method?  
   - A) Static Application Security Testing (SAST)  
   - B) Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)  
   - C) ➡️ ✅ Regression Testing  
   - D) Penetration Testing  
> _Regression testing is when tests are re-run when any changes to a codebase are made, aiming to ensure that existing functionality has not been broken_

## **Short Answer Questions**

**4.** *(3 marks)* **(‼️ 1 mark)** Describe three key security benefits of developing secure software.  
> (Confidentiality Integrity Availability) 
> Developing secure software ensures that sensitive data remains only accessible to authorised people. Secure software also ensures that the data on a system retains it's integrity, keeping it as a single point of truth. Secure software also ensures that the system is not vulnerable to attacks that compromise the system's availability.
> **Focus more on the end result, like preventing legal problems by implementing better security**

**5.** *(3 marks)* **(✅ 3 marks)** Explain how encryption and authentication help protect data in software systems.  
> Encryption refers to the process of making data unreadable unless a certain key is given. This key 'locks' the data, and keeping the key in the hands of authorised persons only ensures that bad actors cannot read sensitive data. Authentication refers to the process of authorising only specific, authorised people, from accessing sensitive data. Authentication ensures that data in software systems are always **confidential** (as it only allows authorised people to read the data), retains it's **integrity** (as only authorised people may be able to edit the data), and ensure it's **availability** (as authorisation systems are also able to prevent attacks that impact availability of the data like DOS/DDOS)
