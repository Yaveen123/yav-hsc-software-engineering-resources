## **Code-Based Questions**

**7.** *(4 marks)* Write a **Python function** that reads a file called `data.txt`, counts the number of lines in the file, and prints the total count. 

**8.** *(4 marks)* The following code aims to **find the smallest number** in a list, but it contains a bug. Identify and fix the issue.
